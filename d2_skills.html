                <p>This design is the main website design that I went with. It has the dark theme with the bright cyan colours and has rounded corners for every section. I went with a simple layout which is very responsive and doesn't show too much info at once. It also has breaks in between which make it easier to read. The dark background, and the combination of light colours makes it easy to read.</p>

                <img alt="css1page" id="d2" src="imgs/css2.png">
                <p>This design is very similar to the first website design. However, the colours have been changed. This is mostly suitable for those that have difficulty reading on dark backgrounds and that hasn't got much contrast. This version has different responsiveness when used on a mobile device than the first one, and this is because it looked a lot better this way than normal. The user can switch to this design at any given time without any issues using the 'Design 2' button below.</p>

                <p>This page include the javascript code for the coffee application which I created. Using this link you can place your coffee order depending on your mood. It has all the available options and the prices on the menu. You select the item numbers and put them in the input box. Once you're done it, you add it to the basket and when you're happy with the basket, you then press place the order. It then shows you the confirmation with the total price of your order and you can either accept or decline it. </p>
